# spark-drools

1) This Project will show how to use the spark job to fire the rules.<br>
2) Simple Credit Approval logic, if the Applicant Credit score is greater than 600, fire the rules (approve the loan). <br>
3) approval.drl (drool file) holds the business logic.<br>
4) I have checked in the sucessful output.log. <br>
