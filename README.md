# spark-drools

1) This Project will show how to use the spark job to fire the rules.<br>
2) Simple Credit Approval logic, if the Applicant Credit score is greater than 600, fire the rules (approve the loan). <br>
3) Approval.drl (drool file) holds the business logic.<br>
4) I have checked in the sucessful output.log. <br>
5) Project can be easily imported as an Maven Project and fitted to be running in any ide.
6) Idea is based on this video https://www.redhat.com/en/about/videos/red-hat-consulting-decision-manager-and-apache-spark-integration. <br>
